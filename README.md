## **1. Project Description**

This project is a simple, user-friendly website created using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The purpose of the site is to demonstrate our understanding of:

- Web layout and page structure  
- Styling with external CSS

- Building a clear and accessible user experience  

The result is a small website that is easy to navigate, responsive on different screens, and visually clean.
